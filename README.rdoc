Flend.co is all about requesting to borrow an item from someone. It will allow you to request an item and will notify people who may be able to lend it to you.
Built using Ruby on Rails for a front end, hosted on Heroku, and Node.js for the back-end, hosted on Microsoft Azure. Database utilizes MongoDB hosted by MongoLabs.
Utilizes Rails ActiveResource to communicate directly with a cross platform RESTful API.
If we get time there may even be an iOS app!
